description: "An overview of the DynamicLink NaaS observability suite, the Unified Insights Dashboard, and the troubleshooting funnel methodology."
---

The DynamicLink Network as a Service (NaaS) platform provides a suite of powerful observability tools designed to give IT Managers comprehensive visibility into their network's health, performance, and security posture. The central hub for this visibility is the **Insights** tab, which serves as the primary command center for all monitoring and troubleshooting activities.

This is not merely a collection of disparate charts and graphs; it is a correlated system designed to present a holistic view of the enterprise network, from high-level infrastructure status down to the granular details of individual traffic flows.

## The Troubleshooting Funnel

A key principle behind the platform's design is the concept of a troubleshooting "funnel." This structure guides you through a logical and efficient diagnostic process, enabling you to move from a high-level understanding of a problem's location ("what") to the granular, log-level data required for root cause analysis ("why").

This prevents the common pitfall of getting lost in low-level data prematurely and streamlines the path to resolution. The funnel begins with the broadest view and allows for progressively deeper dives:

1. **High-Level Visualization (The "What"):** Your first destination is typically the **Topology** view.

This dashboard provides an immediate, graphical representation of all network locations, cloud connections, and their real-time operational status. A color-coded indicator, such as a red link or node, serves as an instant visual alert, directing attention to the precise area of a problem.
4. **Performance Analysis (The "Where"):** From the topology, you can "funnel down" into the **Network and Application Observability** dashboards.

 These views provide the performance context, displaying critical metrics such as latency, packet drops, bandwidth utilization, and application-specific data. This step helps to characterize the nature of the problemâ€”is it a connectivity failure, a performance degradation, or an application-specific issue?
7. **Granular Statistics (The "How Much"):** If more quantitative detail is needed, the next layer of the funnel consists of raw **Interface and Service Statistics**. These detailed counters for traffic, packets, and connections can be accessed throughout the portal by switching to the statistics view (indicated by a pie-chart icon) or by accessing the integrated Grafana dashboards for time-series analysis.
8. **Deep Forensics (The "Why"):** The deepest level of the funnel is reserved for forensic analysis. This includes reviewing **Events** logs, performing complex queries in **Kibana**, and using the **Looking Glass** tool for active, real-time diagnostics like packet captures.

## Core Insights Dashboards

This structured approach is embedded within the core dashboards available under the "Insights" tab:

- **Topology View:** Presents a graphical overview of the tenant's network, showing all physical and cloud locations and the connections between them. It displays overall traffic metrics and serves as a central point for viewing tenant-specific events.
- **Application Observability:** Provides detailed insights into application usage, user activity, and DNS query patterns. It is the primary tool for understanding how network resources are being consumed at the application layer.
- **Network Observability:** Focuses on the underlying network performance, offering analytics on traffic volume, geolocation data, connection flows, and latency metrics.
- **Cyber Threats:** This security-focused dashboard displays alerts and comprehensive information about any security threats detected within the tenant's traffic, serving as the starting point for any security investigation.

By understanding and utilizing this "funnel" methodology, you can navigate the platform's rich data sets with purpose and efficiency, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.

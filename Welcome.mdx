Welcome to DynamicLink! Follow these three steps to begin using the platform.

### [1. Add users to your tenant](/docs/users)

As an account Administrator, add team members to your tenant.


<Note>
If you're the first person to register your company, you're automatically assigned the Account Administrator role. If you're joining an existing organization, contact your Account Administrator for access.
</Note>


### [2. Provision a port](/docs/ports)

A port is a physical connection point between your network and the DynamicLink infrastructure. 

At this time, all ports must be ordered through Tranzact. 


### [3. Get familiar with DashAI](docs/dash-ai)

DashAI is an AI-powered assistant integrated into the DynamicLink portal that can help you:

- **Get instant answers**: Ask questions about DynamicLink processes, troubleshooting, and concepts. DashAI uses DynamicLink knowledge base to provide accurate, up-to-date answers.
- **Manage resources**: Use natural language to create, view, update, or delete network resources.

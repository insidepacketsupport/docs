Welcome to DynamicLink! Follow these steps to begin using the platform.

### 1. Add users to your tenant

As an Administrator, add team members to your tenant (your DynamicLink organization).

See [Users](/docs/users).

<Note>
  If you're the first person to register your company, you're automatically assigned the Administrator role.

  If you're joining an existing organization, contact an Administrator for access.
</Note>

### 2. Provision a port

A port is a physical connection point between your network and the DynamicLink infrastructure.

At this time, all ports must be ordered through Tranzact.

See [Ports](/docs/ports).

### 3. Request an API token

If you are planning to use the API, you will need a token associated with your user account.

See our [developer portal](https://developer.zayo.com/). 

### 4. Get familiar with DashAI

DashAI is an AI-powered assistant integrated into the DynamicLink portal that can help you:

- **Get instant answers**: Ask questions about DynamicLink processes, troubleshooting, and concepts. DashAI uses DynamicLink knowledge base to provide accurate, up-to-date answers.
- **Manage resources**: Use natural language to create, view, update, or delete network resources.

See [DashAI](docs/dash-ai).

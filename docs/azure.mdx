Azure ExpressRoute lets you create private connections between your on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft Azure services.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an Azure ExpressRoute connection, ensure you have:

- An active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.
- A DynamicLink port with available bandwidth.

## Step 1: Create an ExpressRoute circuit in Azure

First, you need to create an ExpressRoute circuit in the Azure portal. This is required to obtain a service key, which you will then use to provision your connection in DynamicLink. 

Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and use the search bar at the top to find the **ExpressRoute circuits** page. 

Click **Create** and then complete the following fields:

**Configuration**

| Field | Description |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Subscription** | Your [subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) is created at the account level and determines how you are billed.   |
| **Resource group** | A resource group acts like a folder that organizes related resources. You can use it to perform actions on multiple resources at once—for example, applying permissions, duplicating configurations, or deleting the entire group. <br/><br/>Each resource can belong to only one resource group, and each resource group is associated with a single subscription. |
| **Resiliency** | Select your resiliency type. For more information, see [Design and architect Azure ExpressRoute for resiliency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/design-architecture-for-resiliency). |
| **Region** | Select the Azure region that you want to use. This region represents the availability zone or data center in which a resource is located. <br/><br/>This region does not need to match your Zayo peering location. For example, you may want to choose the same region as other resources within your selected resource group. |
| **Circuit name** | Enter a name for the circuit. |
| **Port type** | Select **Provider**. |
| **Peering location** | Choose from the available on-ramp locations provided by Zayo. |
| **Provider** | Select **Zayo DynamicLink**. |
| **Bandwidth** | Select your desired capacity. |
| **SKU** | Choose the appropriate [service tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/expressroute/). |
| **Billing model** | Select the correct billing option. <br/><br/>• **Metered:** Usage-based billing.<br/>• **Unlimited:** Fixed monthly rate. |

<Note>
The SKU and billing model apply only to Microsoft’s billing structure. Zayo billing is separate.
</Note>

**Monitoring**

Here you can enable monitoring rules to receive alerts when certain events occur, such as a drop in BGP availability or high bandwidth utilization. 

For more information, see [Monitor Azure ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute). 

**Tags**

Here you can add tags as name/value pairs. These can help you organize and sort resources across groups. 

For more information, see [Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources). 

**Review + create**

Confirm your selections and then click **Create**. 

It may take a few moments for your ExpressRoute resource to deploy. When it's complete, click **Go to resource**.

From your resource list, select the ExpressRoute circuit you just created. From here, you find and copy the **Service key**:

## Step 2: Create the connection in DynamicLink

Once you have your ExpressRoute service key from Azure, return to the DynamicLink portal.

Navigate to **Build Your Network > Ports**. Click **Add a Connection** in the upper right or click **Add connection** next to the port you are using. 

Complete the following fields:

**"A" Port**

Select **Customer Port** and then complete the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Port** | Select your source port. |
| **VLAN** | Enter an available VLAN. |
| **BW** | You can leave this blank. It will pre-populate when you enter your service key. |

**"Z" Port**

Select **Cloud Connection** and then select **Azure**. Complete the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Service Key** | Enter the service key you copied from the Azure portal. |
| **BW** | This is automatically populated with the bandwidth you selected when creating your ExpressRoute circuit. |
| **Peering Location** | This is automatically populated with the peering location you selected when creating your ExpressRoute circuit. |
| **Connection Type** | Select the [peering type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-circuit-peerings) you want to use: <br/><br/>• **Azure Private Peering:** For private virtual networks and Azure services.<br/>• **Microsoft Peering:** For accessing Microsoft services like Office 365 and Dynamics 365.    |
| **VLAN** | Enter a VLAN that is unique to this circuit. You will use this when configuring peering in the Azure portal. |


<Note>
You can configure both peering types if your use case requires access to both private Azure resources and Microsoft services.
</Note>

Enter a connection name and then click **Add**. 
 
## Step 3: Create a secondary connection (optional)

You can re-use your service key to create a secondary circuit connection. 

This is optional, but recommended. 

## Step 4: Set up peering

Return to the Azure portal and open your ExpressRoute circuit. From here you can finish setting up peering. 

See [Create and modify peering for an ExpressRoute circuit using the Azure portal](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/expressroute/expressroute-howto-routing-portal-resource-manager).

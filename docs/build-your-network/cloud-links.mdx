description: "Learn how to create Data Center-to-Data Center (DC-to-DC) connections and establish direct connectivity to major cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure."

**Overview**
Cloud Links allow you to create powerful connections between your physical ports. You can establish a direct, private link between two data centers (DC-to-DC) or connect seamlessly to a rich ecosystem of cloud service providers. This enhances performance, improves security, and provides a scalable foundation for your hybrid or multi-cloud strategy.

Creating a DC-to-DC Connection
Establish a direct, private connection between two of your data center ports.

Navigate to Ports: Go to Build Your Network \> Ports.

Check Port Availability: Ensure both the A-side and Z-side ports have enough available bandwidth for the new connection.

Add Connection: On one of the ports (the A-side), click Add a Connection. The port name will be auto-populated.

Configure A-Side Port: Select an available VLAN and specify the desired bandwidth.

Configure Z-Side Port: For the Z-side, select the second data center port you wish to connect to.

Choose Z-Side VLAN: Pick an available VLAN for the second port. The bandwidth will be automatically filled based on the A-side configuration.

Name the Connection: Provide a descriptive name for your DC-to-DC link.

Finalize: Click Add to create the connection.

Cloud NNI Management (Cloud Connectivity)
Connect directly to major cloud providers through a Network-to-Network Interface (NNI). This provides secure, reliable, and low-latency access to your cloud resources.

  <Tab title="AWS Direct Connect">
    AWS Direct Connect Setup
    Start Connection: Navigate to Build Your Network \> Ports and click Add a Connection on your desired port.

    Configure A-Side (Your Port): Select a VLAN and desired bandwidth.

    Configure Z-Side (AWS):

    Select Cloud Connection.

    Choose AWS as the provider and Direct Connection.

    Enter your AWS Customer ID and a Connection Name.

    Create Connection: Click Add. The connection status will show as Ordering.

    Approve in AWS Console:

    Log in to your AWS account. The new connection will appear in the Direct Connect section.

    Approve the connection. The status will change to Pending.

    Activation: After about 5 minutes, AWS will establish the connection, and the status will change to Available in both the NaaS portal and AWS console.

    Configure BGP: Once available, set up a BGP session on a Virtual Interface (VIF) in AWS to exchange routes.

  <Tab title="GCP Cloud Interconnect">
    GCP Direct Connect Setup
    Create VLAN Attachment in GCP:

    In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Network Connectivity \> Interconnect.

    Create a new Partner VLAN Attachment, providing details like network, region, and Cloud Router.

    Google will provide a Pairing Key. Copy this key.

    Create Connection in NaaS Portal:

    Navigate to Build Your Network \> Ports and click Add a Connection.

    For the Z-Port, select Cloud Connection and choose GCP.

    Paste the Pairing Key from GCP. The region will auto-fill.

    Select the bandwidth and provide a connection name.

    Activate and Configure BGP:

    Click Add. The connection status will become Pending and then Active.

    Once active, you must click Configure BGP in the NaaS portal and add your BGP details to complete the setup.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure ExpressRoute">
    Azure ExpressRoute Setup
    Create ExpressRoute Circuit in Azure:

    In the Azure portal, create a new ExpressRoute circuit.

    Configure the resiliency, location, provider (e.g., Zayo), bandwidth, and billing model.

    Once deployed, Azure will provide a Service Key.

    Create Connection in NaaS Portal:

    Navigate to Build Your Network \> Ports and click Add a Connection.

    For the Z-Port, select Cloud Connection and choose Azure.

    Paste the Service Key. The location and region will auto-populate.

    Select the connection type (Private, Public, or Microsoft) and set the VLAN.

    Provisioning and BGP:

    Click Add. The provider status in Azure will change from Not Provisioned to Provisioned.

    Finally, configure BGP peering within the Azure ExpressRoute circuit settings for the connection type you selected.

Redundancy
For all cloud connections, you can establish a redundant link by repeating the connection process on a secondary port, ensuring high availability for your critical workloads.

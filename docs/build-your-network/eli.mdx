  **What You'll Accomplish**

  This guide will walk you through the process of provisioning a private, point-to-point Layer 2 circuit between two data center ports on the DynamicLink NaaS platform.
</Info>

To create a Layer 2 data center-to-data center (DC-to-DC) connection in DynamicLink, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Ports">
    Start by logging into the DynamicLink portal. From the main dashboard, click on the **Build Your Network** tab, and then select **Ports** from the sub-menu.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Port Availability">
    Before creating the connection, it's crucial to verify that both the A-side and Z-side ports have enough capacity. Review the `Available Bandwidth` for each port to ensure there is sufficient bandwidth for your new circuit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the A-Side Port">
    1. Locate the first port for your connection and click the **Add a Connection** button next to it.
    2. The port name will be automatically populated.
    3. Choose an available VLAN from the dropdown menu.
    4. Specify the desired bandwidth for the connection (e.g., `1 Gbps`).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Z-Side Port">
    1. In the Z-port section, select the second data center port you wish to connect to.
    2. Choose an available VLAN from the dropdown menu. Ensure this VLAN has not been used previously on this port.
    3. The bandwidth will automatically match the value you selected for the A-side port.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Finalize the Connection">
    1. Provide a meaningful and easily identifiable name for your new connection in the `Connection Name` field.
    2. Review all the details to ensure they are correct.
    3. Click the **Add** button at the bottom of the page to finalize the setup and create the connection.

    Your new Layer 2 connection will now be provisioned and will appear in your list of active connections.

## Overview

The **Order Log** provides a comprehensive and detailed audit trail of every action performed within your NaaS portal account. It serves as a centralized place to monitor the status of pending requests, review historical changes, and verify all provisioning activities. Whether you've ordered a new port, deleted a connection, or enabled a new service, the Order Log captures it all.

## How to Access the Order Log

You can access the Order Log directly from the main navigation menu.

1. **Navigate to Order Log:** In the left-side menu, under the **Build Your Network** section, click on **Order Log**.
2. **View Activities:** The log will display a chronological list of all actions performed.

## Understanding the Order Log Table

The Order Log is presented in a clear table format, providing key details for each event.

### Columns in the Log

- **Timestamp:** The exact date and time the action was performed.
- **Activity:** The type of action taken, such as `Create`, `Delete`, or `Enable`.
- **Item:** The type of resource that was affected, for example:
  - Port
  - Connection
  - Public IPs
  - Service/Package
- **Name:** The specific name of the resource that was changed (e.g., `Evoque WDC1 port_1` or `Network Observability`).

### Filtering the Log

To help you find specific information quickly, the Order Log includes powerful filtering capabilities. You can filter the entire log by a specific category, such as **Ports**, **Links**, **Cloud**, **Public IPs**, or **Services**, to narrow down the results and focus only on the events that are relevant to your search.

Firewall Configuration
The firewall allows you to control traffic flow between network segments. You can create rules to explicitly allow or drop traffic based on various parameters.

Navigate to Firewall: Go to Services > Firewall.

Add a Rule: Click the + Add button.

Configure Rule:

Web Filtering
Web Filtering enhances security by allowing you to block access to websites based on categories and specific threats. This feature can be enabled as an action in your firewall rules.

Content Filtering: Block categories like Adult, Social Network, or Entertainment.

Web Threats Filtering: Protect against Phishing URLs, Spam, Malicious Websites, and Hacking/C2C domains.

Custom URL Filtering: Create custom allow/deny lists using specific URLs or wildcard patterns.

To use Web Filtering, simply select it as the Action when creating a firewall rule.

Network Address Translation (NAT)
NAT allows you to translate private IP addresses to public IPs, enabling devices on your private network to access the internet.

To create a NAT rule:

Navigate to NAT: Go to Services > NAT.

Add a Rule: Click + Add.

Configure Rule:

Name: Assign a name to the rule.

Type: Specify the NAT type (e.g., Source NAT).

## Overview 🌐

Public IP addresses are essential for making your services accessible from the internet. The DynamicLink portal provides a streamlined process to request and manage blocks of **IPv4** or **IPv6** addresses. Once a public IP block is assigned to your account, you can use it to provision powerful services like **Dedicated Internet Access (DIA)**, including advanced connections that use **BGP** for routing.

This guide will walk you through ordering IPs and configuring both standard and BGP-enabled DIA connections.

## How to Order Public IPs

Your existing IP pool, already assigned to your network, is displayed on the Public IPs page. Follow these steps to request a new block.

1. **Navigate to Public IPs**: From the main portal menu, go to **Build Your Network \> Public IPs**.
2. **Request IPs**: Click the **\+ Request IP** button to open the request form.
3. **Configure Your Request**:
   - **Name**: Give your request a descriptive name for easy identification (e.g., `WebApp-DIA-IPs-London`).
   - **Location**: Select the metro location where the IP addresses will be used.
   - **Pool Size**: Choose the size of the IP block you need from the dropdown menu (e.g., `/29` for 5 usable IPs, `/28` for 13 usable IPs).
4. **Submit Request**: Click **Request**. Your request will be provisioned and the new IP block will be added to your pool.

## How to Create a Standard DIA Connection

A standard DIA connection provides dedicated, reliable internet service with symmetrical (equal upload/download) bandwidth.

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

- **Public IP**: Ensure you have an available Public IP block in the desired location by checking the **Public IPs** tab.
- **Port Bandwidth**: Go to the **Ports** tab and confirm the port in that same location has enough available bandwidth for the new connection.

### Step 2: Create the Connection

1. **Start Connection**: Navigate to the **Ports** tab, find the desired port, and click **Add a Connection**. The A-side (your port) will be auto-populated.
2. **Configure A-Side**: Set up the **VLAN** and select the **bandwidth speed** for the connection.
3. **Configure Z-Side (Internet)**:
   - In the Z-side destination search box, select the **Internet** link.
   - Under **DIA Name**, a dropdown will appear. Pick the **Public IP block** you want to use for this connection.
4. **Finalize**: Confirm the bandwidth and other details, then click **Add** to activate the DIA connection.

## How to Create a BGP DIA Connection

A BGP DIA connection offers advanced routing capabilities, allowing you to announce your own IP addresses (**BYOIP**) or set up multi-homed connections for enhanced resilience.

### Step 1: Set Up Your ASN

- Navigate to **Build Your Network \> Public IPs**.
- If you are bringing your own IP space, find the **ASN** section and click **\+ Set up new**.
- Enter your **Autonomous System Number** and save it.

### Step 2: Create the BGP Connection

1. **Request IP (If Needed)**: If you are not using your own IPs, request a new block by following the steps in the first section.
2. **Create the Connection**: Follow the same initial steps as a standard DIA connection (select port, configure A-side).
3. **Configure BGP**: In the Z-side (Internet) configuration, you will see a toggle or checkbox to **Use BGP**.
   - Enable this option.
   - Choose the **ASN** you configured in the previous step.
4. **Finalize**: Complete the connection setup. After activation, you will need to configure your BGP peering details on your edge device.

## How to Modify DIA Connection Speed

You can easily adjust the bandwidth of an existing DIA connection.

1. **Access Connection Settings**: Locate your DIA connection in your connection list and click the **Edit icon** (pencil).
2. **Verify Port Bandwidth**: Before increasing speed, ensure the underlying physical port has enough available capacity to support the change.
3. **Edit Bandwidth**: In the connection settings, change the **bandwidth** to your desired new speed (e.g., from 50 Mbps to 100 Mbps).
4. **Save Changes**: Click **Edit** to apply the new speed. The change is typically provisioned within minutes.

title: "E-Lines"
---

E-Line services connect exactly two endpoints (A-side and Z-side ports) creating a transparent Layer 2 link between sites:

- **Layer 2**: Operates at the Ethernet/Data Link layer using MAC addresses
- **Private & Dedicated**: Provides isolated, uncontended bandwidth between your locations
- **VLAN-Based**: Uses VLANs to segment and identify the connection
- **Flexible Bandwidth**: Supports various bandwidth options from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps

<Note>
  E-Lines are not EPL connections.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before creating an E-Line connection, ensure you have:

- Two provisioned ports in DynamicLink (one for A-side, one for Z-side)
- Sufficient available bandwidth on both ports
- An understanding of which VLANs are available on each port

## Create an E-Line connection

Navigate to **Build Your Network \> Ports** in the DynamicLink portal. Click **Add a Connection** in the upper right or click **Add connection** next to the port you are using.

Complete the following fields:

**"A" Port**

Select **Customer Port** and then complete the following fields:

| Field    | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Port** | Select your source port.       |
| **VLAN** | Enter an available VLAN.       |
| **BW**   | Select your desired bandwidth. |

**"Z" Port**

Select **Customer Port** again and then complete the fields as described above.

Enter a name for the connection and then click **Add**.

## Best practices

When creating E-Line connections, consider the following:

- **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names that include location identifiers (e.g., "NYC-DC1-to-CHI-DC2")
- **Bandwidth**: Size your bandwidth based on expected traffic patterns and peak usage
- **Redundancy**: For critical connections, consider creating redundant E-Line services on separate ports for high availability

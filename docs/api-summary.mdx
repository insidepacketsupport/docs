The DynamicLink API is a comprehensive RESTful API that allows you to interact with DynamicLink programmatically to manage your network infrastructure, services, and resources.

The DynamicLink API exposes the full functionality of the DynamicLink platform, allowing you to:

- **Automate Network Operations**: Provision and manage network resources without manual intervention
- **Build Custom Integrations**: Connect DynamicLink with your existing tools, workflows, and systems
- **Create Third-Party Applications**: Develop applications that leverage DynamicLink's network capabilities
- **Implement Infrastructure as Code**: Manage your network infrastructure through code and version control
- **Enable CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate network provisioning into your deployment workflows

## API reference documentation

For detailed information about specific endpoints, request/response formats, and examples, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) documentation.

## Key capabilities

- **Tenant and user management**
- **Network infrastructure**
- **Cloud connections**
- **Routing and BGP**
- **Security services**
- **Network insights**
- **Monitoring and diagnostics**

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. The API uses the `HTTPBearerFromCookie` security scheme, which supports tokens obtained through the authentication flow.

To get a Bearer token, you must request one from Zayo here: [Zayo Developer Portal](https://developer.zayo.com/)

## API structure

The DynamicLink API follows RESTful conventions:

- **GET** - Retrieve resources and query information
- **POST** - Create new resources
- **PUT** - Update existing resources
- **DELETE** - Remove resources

All responses are returned in JSON format with standard HTTP status codes.

## Examples

The DynamicLink API is designed to make integration straightforward. Here are common integration patterns:

### Automation workflows

Automate repetitive network management tasks:

```bash
# Example: Automate DIA provisioning
curl -X POST "https://api.dynamiclink.zayo.com/tenant/{tenant_name}/dia" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "production-dia",
    "bandwidth": 1000,
    "public_ip_pool": "dia-pool-1"
  }'
```

### Infrastructure as code

Use the API with tools like Terraform, Ansible, or custom scripts to manage your network as code:

```python
# Example: Python integration for automated provisioning
import requests

def create_cloud_router(tenant_name, router_config):
    response = requests.post(
        f"https://api.dynamiclink.zayo.com/service/{tenant_name}/connection/connections",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
        json=router_config
    )
    return response.json()
```

### Event-driven integrations

Build integrations that respond to network events and changes:

```bash
# Monitor connection status
curl -X GET "https://api.dynamiclink.zayo.com/service/{tenant_name}/connection/connections" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Best practices

When building integrations with the DynamicLink API:

- **Use Idempotent Operations**: Design your integration to handle retries safely
- **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Check HTTP status codes and handle errors gracefully
- **Respect Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff and respect API rate limits
- **Secure Your Credentials**: Never expose API tokens in logs, code repositories, or client-side applications
- **Version Your Integrations**: Be prepared for API changes and version your integration code
- **Monitor API Usage**: Track your API usage to optimize performance and costs
- **Test in Non-Production**: Always test integrations in a non-production environment first

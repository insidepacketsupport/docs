Network ports are the physical connection points that serve as the foundation for all network connectivity in DynamicLink. They represent the critical interface between your internal network infrastructure and the Zayo network fabric, enabling secure and reliable data transmission across your network.

## Port overview

A **Port** is a physical connection point that acts as a bridge between your organization's internal network and the Zayo network infrastructure. Think of it as a dedicated gateway that allows your network traffic to enter and exit the platform's managed network environment.

Before you can begin building connections, you must have at least one port. 

## Order ports

At this time, all ports must be ordered through [Tranzact](https://tranzact.zayo.com/). 

Once your port is ordered, it will appear as **Pending** in DynamicLink until fully provisioned. 

Once provisioned, you can add connections to the port through DynamicLink. 

<Note>
The ability to create ports will be available in DynamicLink in 2026.

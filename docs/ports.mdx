A **Port** is a physical connection point that acts as a bridge between your organization's internal network and the Zayo network infrastructure. Think of it as a dedicated gateway that allows your network traffic to enter and exit the platform's managed network environment.

Before you can begin building connections, you must have at least one port. 

## Order ports

At this time, all ports must be ordered through [Tranzact](https://tranzact.zayo.com/). 

Once your port is ordered, it will appear as **Pending** in DynamicLink until fully provisioned. 

Once provisioned, you can add connections to the port through DynamicLink. 

<Note>
The ability to create ports will be available in DynamicLink in 2026.

## Order a port through Tranzact

To order a DynamicLink port through [Tranzact](https://tranzact.zayo.com/), complete the following steps:

1. Select to **Quotes & Orders**. 
2. Select **Access Port**
3. Select a port location and contract length, and then complete the following configuration details: 
    * **Port Speed**: Select the bandwidth for your access port. You will have the chance to commit a lower bandwidth with DynamicLink. 
    * **LACP on Port**: Enable or disable Link Aggregation Control Protocol. You will need to enable LACP if you are intending to use this port as part of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG), where you combine two or more physical ports into one logical interface. 
    * **Handoff**: You have the following options:
        * **2-Fiber SMF**: Single-mode fiber; better for longer distances such as metro fiber, data centers connecting buildings, and backbone links. 
        * **2-Fiber MMF**: Multi-mode fiber; better for inside data centers, short runs, server-to-switch links. 
    * **LOA/CFA Provided By**: Select who you want to issue the LOA/CFA. This determines the direction of the cross connect. 
    
        If you want an inbound cross connect from Zayo, select **Customer**. You will need to provide us with a LOA/CFA. 

        If you want an outbound cross connect from you to Zayo, we will provide the LOA/CFA.

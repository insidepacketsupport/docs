## Creating a Firewall Rule

Firewall rules allow you to control traffic flow based on specific criteria. To create a new firewall rule, follow these steps:

1. In the Admin GUI, navigate to the **Services** menu option.
2. Select **Firewall**.
3. Click the **Add** button to open the "Create Firewall Rule" dialog.
4. Fill out the fields in the dialog box:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for the firewall rule (e.g., `Allow-Web-Traffic-From-Office`).
   - **Priority**: Set the priority for the rule. Lower values indicate higher priority (e.g., `100` is higher priority than `200`).
   - **Admin State**: Enable or disable the rule.
   - **Description**: (Optional) A more detailed description of the rule's purpose.
   - **IP Protocol**: Specify the IP version (`IPv4` or `IPv6`). This must match the version used in the Source and Destination IP fields.
   - **Protocol**: Select the transport layer protocol (e.g., `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, or `Any`).
   - **Action**: Choose the action to take when the rule is matched (`Permit` or `Deny`).
   - **Source**: Define the source IP prefix (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) or a pre-defined IP Group.
   - **Destination**: Define the destination IP prefix or a pre-defined IP Group.
   - **Source Port**: Specify the source port or a port range (e.g., `1024-65535`).
   - **Destination Port**: Specify the destination port or a port range (e.g., `443` for HTTPS).
   - **Source VI**: Select the source Virtual Interface (VI) where the traffic originates.
   - **Destination VI**: Select the destination Virtual Interface (VI) where the traffic is headed.
5. Click **Add** to save and apply the new rule.

### How Rules Are Processed

It is important to understand how the firewall processes rules to ensure your policies are effective:

- **Execution by Priority**: Firewall rules are executed in order of their priority value, starting with the lowest number. The first rule that matches the traffic is the one that is applied.
- **Logical AND Condition**: All the filters (Source, Destination, Port, etc.) within a single rule are combined with a logical **AND**. This means that for a rule to be triggered, _all_ specified conditions within that rule must be true for the given network packet.

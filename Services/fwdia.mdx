## Introduction 

This guide provides a step-by-step process for creating firewall rules specifically for your Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) service. These rules are essential for securing your network by controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

## Creating a New DIA Firewall Rule

Follow these instructions carefully to configure a new rule.

1. **Navigate to DIA Firewall**
   - In the Admin GUI, open the **Services** menu from the main navigation bar.
   - From the dropdown, select **DIA Firewall**. This will take you to the DIA firewall rule management page.
2. **Add a New Rule**
   - Click the **Add** button to launch the "Create DIA Firewall Rule" dialog box.
3. **Configure Rule Parameters**
   - Fill in the following fields to define the behavior of your rule:
   - **Name**: Enter a unique and descriptive name that helps you identify the rule's purpose (e.g., `Block-Outbound-FTP`).
   - **Priority**: Assign a numerical value. **Lower numbers have higher priority** and are processed first.
   - **Admin State**: Toggle to **Enable** or **Disable** the rule. New rules should be enabled to be active.
   - **Description**: (Optional) Provide a detailed explanation of what the rule does for future reference.
   - **IP Protocol**: Select either `IPv4` or `IPv6`. This choice must match the IP version of the Source and Destination prefixes.
   - **Protocol**: Choose the transport protocol, such as `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, or select `Any` to have the rule apply to all protocols.
   - **Action**:
     - `Permit`: Allows traffic that matches the rule.
     - `Deny`: Blocks traffic that matches the rule.
   - **Source**: Define the traffic's origin by entering an IP prefix (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`) or selecting a pre-configured IP Group.
   - **Destination**: Define the traffic's destination by entering an IP prefix or selecting a pre-configured IP Group.
   - **Source Port**: Specify the source port number or a range (e.g., `1024-65535`).
   - **Destination Port**: Specify the destination port number or a range (e.g., `22` for SSH).
   - **Source VI**: Select the source Virtual Interface (VI) where the traffic originates.
   - **Destination VI**: Select the destination Virtual Interface (VI) where the traffic is going.
4. **Save the Rule**
   - After reviewing your settings, click the **Add** button at the bottom of the dialog to save and activate the new rule.

> **Key Concept: Rule Processing Logic**
> Firewall rules are processed based on their **Priority**, with lower numbers being evaluated first. For a rule's action (`Permit` or `Deny`) to be applied, all the defined filters (Source, Destination, Port, etc.) within that single rule must match the traffic. This is a logical **AND** condition.

## Operator-Defined, Tenant-Managed Protection

Our DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection service operates on a multi-tenant model where tenants do not create their own rules from scratch. Instead, the system operator defines a comprehensive set of rules. This approach ensures a baseline of security for the entire platform while empowering tenants to customize protection within operator-defined boundaries.

Tenants with a Direct Internet Access (DIA) connection rely on these rules, which are configured for the `internet` VRF on each system.

## Operator Configuration

The operator is responsible for setting up both the baseline protection and the customizable templates for tenants.

### Default DDoS Policies

These rules form a mandatory layer of security for all tenants and the core `NSOS System`.

- **Purpose**: Provide a non-optional safety net for all tenant DIA connections.
- **Activation**: These rules are always active and cannot be disabled by tenants.
- **Configuration**:
  1. Navigate to **Network Resources > DIA DDoS**.
  2. Select the **DDoS** tab.
  3. Click the `+` button to create a new rule.
  4. In the dialog, select all `NSOS Systems` where the rule should apply. It will be enforced on all VRFs of type `internet`.

<Note>
  Only `NSOS Systems` that support DDoS will appear in the selection list.
</Note>

### DDoS Templates

While default rules are a safety net, templates provide granular, powerful protection that tenants can subscribe to and manage.

- **Purpose**: Allow tenants to enable, disable, and tune protection based on their specific needs without deep policy knowledge.
- **Activation**: Rules from these templates are copied to a tenant's personal DDoS configuration only when they subscribe to the DDoS Service.
- **Configuration**:
  1. Navigate to **Network Resources > DIA DDoS**.
  2. Select the **Templates** tab.
  3. Click the `+` button to create a new template.
  4. Define the policy, including the `Source Interface` for each system (the uplink to the internet).
  5. Create **Options** which represent different device types (e.g., "Server," "Workstation") with unique protection thresholds that override defaults.

<Info>
  The option name `Monitor` is a reserved keyword. Assigning this type to a rule places it in a non-blocking mode where it only detects and reports on attacks without performing mitigation.

## Tenant Experience

A tenant with the DDoS Service enabled on their DIA connection gains access to a dedicated DDoS management interface.

### Attack Monitoring & Status

Upon entering the DDoS screen, the tenant sees a clear status overview.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quiet Time" icon="check-circle" color="#28a745">
    A green tile indicates that there are no active attacks. The dashboard will show data from the most recent attack (if any occurred within the last 30 days).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Under Attack" icon="shield-exclamation" color="#dc3545">
    A red tile signals an ongoing attack. The screen provides details on attack size, targeted hosts, and traffic graphs comparing clean vs. mitigated traffic. The tile remains red for 5 minutes after the last attack.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Rule Management

Tenants can click on the **DDoS Rules** section to control their protection policies. For each rule copied from the operator's templates, the tenant has two primary controls:

1.  **Change Protection Type**: The tenant can select from the list of device types (e.g., `Server`, `Workstation`) that the operator configured in the template options. This adjusts the rule's behavior and thresholds.
2.  **Enable Monitor Mode**: The tenant can switch any rule to `Monitor` only. This is useful for observing potential threats without impacting traffic.

This allows tenants to dynamically adjust their security posture based on their needs and current threat landscape.

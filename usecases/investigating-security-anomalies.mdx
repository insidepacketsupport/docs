This playbook provides a structured workflow for responding to a security alert from the platform.

### Step 1: The Alert
The investigation begins with an alert. This could be a notification of a volumetric attack in the **DDoS dashboard** or a specific threat signature match in the **Cyber Threats dashboard**.

### Step 2: Initial Triage
From the alert details, gather the critical initial information: the source IP of the attacker, the destination IP of the target, the type of threat or attack vector, and the exact timestamp of the event.

### Step 3: Forensic Analysis
Pivot to the **Network Observability** dashboard and select the **Detailed Records** view. This view provides access to the raw Session Detail Record (SDR) data. Filter the records by the source and/or destination IP addresses from the alert and the timeframe of the incident. This analysis will reveal the full context of the attack, including any other connections the attacker made.

### Step 4: Containment
Based on the analysis, take immediate action. Navigate to the **Services -> Firewall** dashboard. Create a new, high-priority firewall rule to block all traffic from the malicious source IP address, effectively cutting off the attacker's access.

### Step 5: Proactive Hardening
Review the data from the investigation to identify opportunities for proactive security improvements. For example, in the **Application Observability** dashboard, determine if the attack leveraged an unauthorized or non-standard application. If so, navigate to the **Firewall** configuration and create a **Web Filtering** rule to block the specific URL or the entire category of applications associated with the attack vector, preventing similar incidents.
